# IDEA

Make a simulation that will take different ideas for space bases on Mars and test them against different scenarios. It will return outputs for that scenario and see which one did best in that scenario.

# CODE 

## PROBLEM AND REQUIREMENTS

### LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS

I will need to program different ways to implement life supporting aspects and systems into the simulation. This will include things like **Oxygen Generation**, **Water Recycling**, and **Food Supply** into the simulation.

### Energy Supply

The base will need energy so I am going to need to implement different ideas for the base to get energy. I will need to program in systems to replication ***Solar Panels***, ***Batteries***, or other energy sources.
### Habitats

I am not that good at C yet to implement, render, and create an actual space base in the code. However for the simulation to be accurate I will need to program different facilities into the simulation. This will include things like ***Living Quarters***, ***Recreation Areas***, ***Workspaces***, along with things like ***Communications***, ***Energy Disposal***, ***Computer Room***, etc. These facilities will impact the different factors, which I will come onto next.

### FACTORS 

There will be different factors in the simulation. These factors will fall into two categories: Scenario Factors, and Station Factors. Scenario Factors will be the factors that will change between scenarios. I will change these so the scenarios will differ and see how the bases put up with different conditions. This will be the indepent variable. These will be things like **Weather Conditions**, **Access to sunlight**, **Crew Members Available**, **Starting Energy Supply**.

There will also be Station Factors. These will be the things that will be measured to see how the different bases did. This will be the dependent variable. It will include things like: **Total Energy**, **Disposable Energy**, **Food Supply**, **Water Supply**, **Crew Wellbeing**, **Used Energy**, etc.

## SIMULATION STRUCTURE

### MODULES

I will need to define different things such as *life support*, *energy supply*, and *habitats and facilities*.

### CREWMEMBERS

I will need to create methods and functions to track the dependent variables, such as *health*, *energy*, and *wellbeing* of crewmembers.

### RESOURCES

I should also track variables affecting the station, such as *oxygen supply*, *water*, *food*, and *energy*.

## EXPAND THE SIMULATION

If I manage to program this simulation in reasonable time. I may aswell expand it. I should probably implement some ideas like ***automated energy management***, or ***testing different activities affecting crewmember health***, and *adding random events into the simulation such as* **equipment failures**, **meteor strikes**, **powercuts**, etc.

## ACTUALLY SIMULATING THE SIMULATION

I should implement a way to store the data to a file like CSV or JSON so I don't have to run the simulation everytime I want to see a result.
